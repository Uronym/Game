# Game

Yes, that's actually the name of the project, for now. A better name is a top priority once the project is large enough to justify one!

## Compile

This is a work in progress. Add how you compile the game, so it isn't so hard!

#### Windows (???):

```
Add me!
```

#### Linux (g++):

```
g++ *.cpp *.h -o Game $(pkg-config --cflags --libs allegro-5.0 allegro_image-5.0) -std=c++0x -Wall
```
